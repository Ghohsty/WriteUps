## Welcome!
I am currently in the process of studying to complete the [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) (Offensive Security Certified Professional) course and exam. While gearing up for this experience I had been utilizing tools like OneNote and Obsidian to document my progress, but also realized that I should be publishing them to the web in order to submit my write-ups to various sites (e.g. [@hackthebox](https://hackthebox.eu), [@tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com), etc). This was my first foray into web hosting and web design, even the process of putting this together was a learning experience.
<br><br>
My hope is that this site will provide some educational material for those working through these various CTF challenges, while also serving as a reference for myself and others. Outside of that, it will also serve as a good way for me to practice collating legible write-ups and walkthroughs to simulate actual engagements. While I understand that 'real world' engagements are completely separate from CTF challenges, there is some correlation in regards to how information is presented and findings are accurately/legibly demonstrated in written form.
