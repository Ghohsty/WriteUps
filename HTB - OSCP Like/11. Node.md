# Lessons Learned
# Enumeration
## NMap
Initially received 0 results, so we utilized the -Pn switch as suggested and can see that hadoop is running on port 3000:

```c

Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn

## Manual Review
Navigating to the IP and port 3000 we see a website with a login link there. I've created a 'user.txt' containing these 3 usernames for future if we get to brute forcing.
![HTTP Main](images/Node1.png)  

Poked at the login page with admin/admin, root/root, mark/password, etc as quick tests. Pasting this image so we have the failure verbiage for later:
![Login](images/Node2.png)
## FFuF
Fuzzed our parent directory and came up with the following directory structure. I'm poking around each directory and their all redirecting back to the main page (obviously, 301s). I could continue fuzzing each directory, but I think we'll move on to using Burp Suite to try and spider the site. FFuF's always a good start, though. Maybe I'm just lazy.
```c

## Burp Suite
I already have FoxyProxy configured. If you haven't utilized Burp Suite before, I highly recommend installing this add-on as it will make turning your proxy on/off much easier.  
![node3](images/Node3.png)

Here's my FoxyProxy settings for the 'Burp' line-item:  
![node5](images/Node5.png)

Pretty easy. I started up Burp, turned on the FoxyProxy Burp setting, navigated to the site (http://10.10.10.58:3000), and selected "Proxy > Intercept" within Burp and forwarded all incoming packets. This built out a nice top-level view of the site (sometimes referred to as 'spidering' a site):  
![node4](images/Node4.png)

I'll bet you noticed this, too. There is a folder off of the main site: /api/users. I navigated there in the browser and, in plain text, we have the following print out of usernames and passwords. Passwords appear to be hashes of some sort, I don't recognize a pattern right out of the gate:
```java
0
_id	"59a7365b98aa325cc03ee51c"
username	"myP14ceAdm1nAcc0uNT"
password	"dffc504aa55359b9265cbebe1e4032fe600b64475ae3fd29c07d23223334d0af"
is_admin	true
1
_id	"59a7368398aa325cc03ee51d"
username	"tom"
password	"f0e2e750791171b0391b682ec35835bd6a5c3f7c8d1d0191451ec77b4d75f240"
is_admin	false
2
_id	"59a7368e98aa325cc03ee51e"
username	"mark"
password	"de5a1adf4fedcce1533915edc60177547f1057b61b7119fd130e1f7428705f73"
is_admin	false
3
_id	"59aa9781cced6f1d1490fce9"
username	"rastating"
password	"5065db2df0d4ee53562c650c29bacf55b97e231e3fe88570abc9edd8b78ac2f0"
is_admin	false
```
A bit further, into /latest, we also have the following 'hashes' (we'll call them for now):
```java
0
_id	"59a7368398aa325cc03ee51d"
username	"tom"
password	"f0e2e750791171b0391b682ec35835bd6a5c3f7c8d1d0191451ec77b4d75f240"
is_admin	false
1
_id	"59a7368e98aa325cc03ee51e"
username	"mark"
password	"de5a1adf4fedcce1533915edc60177547f1057b61b7119fd130e1f7428705f73"
is_admin	false
2
_id	"59aa9781cced6f1d1490fce9"
username	"rastating"
password	"5065db2df0d4ee53562c650c29bacf55b97e231e3fe88570abc9edd8b78ac2f0"
is_admin	false
```

Obviously, the item with 'admin' in the name is of most interest. Quick comparison just by looking, it appears our 3 primary users (Mark, Tom, and <s>Travis</s> Rastating) have the same password in each.  

For the remainder of burp suite discovery, note that I've switched to the 'Response' tab inside of the console to retrieve the results listed below. You could, alternatively, navigate to each of these manually, but Burp has done some of the heavy lifting for us.
Example:
![Burp Spider 2](images/Node7.png)

Poking around at each discovery, we see a few .js  files. Namely in /assets/js/app/app.js this information seems useful, as it's pointing to some additional subdirectories that I'm not seeing otherwise:
```
var controllers = angular.module('controllers', []);
var app = angular.module('myplace', [ 'ngRoute', 'controllers' ]);

app.config(function ($routeProvider, $locationProvider) {
  $routeProvider.
    when('/', {
      templateUrl: '/partials/home.html',
      controller: 'HomeCtrl'
    }).
    when('/profiles/:username', {
      templateUrl: '/partials/profile.html',
      controller: 'ProfileCtrl'
    }).
    when('/login', {
      templateUrl: '/partials/login.html',
      controller: 'LoginCtrl'
    }).
    when('/admin', {
      templateUrl: '/partials/admin.html',
      controller: 'AdminCtrl'
    }).
    otherwise({
      redirectTo: '/'
    });

    $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
});
```

I wanted to also gather what I'd seen under admin.js, since this seems pertinent. Although, when navigating to /api/admin/backup you do have to authenticate there, so this info not necessary quite yet.
```
var controllers = angular.module('controllers');

controllers.controller('AdminCtrl', function ($scope, $http, $location, $window) {
  $scope.backup = function () {
    $window.open('/api/admin/backup', '_self');
  }

  $http.get('/api/session')
    .then(function (res) {
      if (res.data.authenticated) {
        $scope.user = res.data.user;
      }
      else {
        $location.path('/login');
      }
    });
});
```
This seems useful, however, hitting the download button doesn't get us a response:
![Download Button](images/Node8.png)

## Hashes
I don't immediately recognize the 'hashes' here, so I ran one through hash-identifier and it appears they are likely SHA-256:
```c

I used [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) to quickly crack these. Looks like it found all but one:
![Hashes](images/Node6.png)
## Logging in
Our strange admin username (myP14ceAdm1nAcc0uNT) has a password of 'machester' which we discovered from the crackstation results. Logging in as that user, we're presented with a 'Download Backup' button. We'll pull this down and see what it contains.
![download_backup](images/Node.9.png)

Cat'd out the file and he output appears to be base64 encoded? I'm making this assumption based on past experrience and the = sign at the end. I used the built in base64 decoding utility and sent the output to a new file ('decoded'):
![](images/Node10.png)  
```
base64 -d myplace.backup > decoded
```

Cat'ing this out is also gibberish. I don't know what any of this is. Performed some research around 'identify linux file type' and came across [this link](https://shapeshed.com/unix-file/). Using the file command, we discover that it is a zip file:
```c
┌──(ghohst㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/node]
└─$ file decoded             
decoded: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract, compression method=store
```
Of course, it is password protected:
```
┌──(ghohst㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/node]
└─$ unzip decoded                                                                                                2 ⨯
Archive:  decoded
   creating: var/www/myplace/
[decoded] var/www/myplace/package-lock.json password: 
```
## Encrypted ZIP File
I'll use zip2john to pull the hash:
```c
┌──(ghohst㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/node]
└─$ zip2john decoded > decoded_hashes.txt

┌──(ghohst㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/node]

```
And then John The Ripper to crack the pw:
```c
┌──(ghohst㉿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/node]
└─$ john --wordlist=~/Downloads/rockyou.txt decoded_hashes.txt 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8

```
This was super fast, actually. We unzip the 'decoded' file again, input the password, and it outputs a 'var' folder (presumably, www from the Node server)

## Zip Contents Review
Since I'm going to need to look at quite a few files, I opened this folder in ATOM and started at the top. App.js was a good lead the first time around, and sure enough we have some interesting info here, as well. It appears that Mark is connected to mongodb, over 27017, with the following credentials:
![](images/Node11.png)  

I'm going to hold on to these line-items in text:
```
const url         = 'mongodb://mark:5AYRft73VtFpc84k@localhost:27017/myplace?authMechanism=DEFAULT&authSource=myplace';
const backup_key  = '45fac180e9eee72f4fd2d9386ea7033e52b7c740afc3d98a8d0230167104d474';
```
## SSH
27017 is closed from the outside, but perhaps this is mark's SSH password (22 is open)?
```c
nc -nvv 10.10.10.58 27017
```
```c
┌──(ghohst㉿kali)-[~]

# Exploitation
We now have a shell.  
Interestingly, tom has the user flag and I can't cat it out as mark:
```c
Last login: Wed Sep 27 02:33:14 2017 from 10.10.14.3

mark@node:~$ ls 
mark@node:~$ cd ..
mark@node:/home$ ls
frank  mark  tom
mark@node:/home$ ls tom
user.txt
```

{: .note }
This was my point of failure. Up until this point, I hadn't needed a write up or to check forums. I will investigate the necessary next steps, but it seems that user access was the furthest I was able to get on my own. I attribute this to being unfamiliar with MongoDB as a whole.
