## NMap
Initially received 0 results, so we utilized the -Pn switch as suggested and can see that hadoop is running on port 3000:
```Bash

Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn

## Manual Review
Navigating to the IP and port 3000 we see a website with a login link there. I've created a 'user.txt' containing these 3 usernames for future if we get to brute forcing.
![HTTP Main](images/node1.png)  

Poked at the login page with admin/admin, root/root, mark/password, etc as quick tests. Pasting this image so we have the failure verbiage for later:

## FFuF
Fuzzed our parent directory and came up with the following directory structure. I'm poking around each directory and their all redirecting back to the main page (obviously, 301s). I could continue fuzzing each directory, but I think we'll move on to using Burp Suite to try and spider the site. FFuF's always a good start, though. Maybe I'm just lazy.

## Burp Suite
I already have FoxyProxy configured. If you haven't utilzied Burp Suite before, I highly recommend installing this add-on as it will make turning your proxy on/off much easier.
![FoxyProxy](images/node3.png)

Here's my FoxyProxy settings for the 'Burp' line-item:
![FoxyProxy Burp Settings](images/node5.png)

Pretty easy. I started up Burp, turned on the FoxyProxy Burp setting, navigated to the site (http://10.10.10.58:3000), and selected "Proxy > Intercept" within Burp and forwarded all incoming packets. This built out a nice top-level view of the site (sometimes referred to as 'spidering' a site):
![FoxyProxy Spider](images/node4.png)

I'll bet you noticed this, too. There is a folder off of the main site: /api/users. I navigated there in the browser and, in plain text, we have the following print out of usernames and passwords. Passwords appear to be hashes of some sort, I don't recognize a pattern right out of the gate:
