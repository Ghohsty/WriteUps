# Enumeration
---
## Machine Prep
I've set a shell variable of $ip to point to 10.10.10.4 to make my life a little easier:
```
ip=10.10.10.40
```

## NMAP
Fast NMAP Scan  
I am running this first in order to identify ALL open ports quickly - I will then run a more advanced scan, focusing on these specific ports, afterwards. I am trying to get into the habit of being more focused with my enumeration.

SMB seems to be a popular theme between all of our Windows Boxes!
We'll run with the assumption that this scan is accurate and will note that this box appears to be running:

## SMB
Continuing on with our SMB/SAMBA themed boxes. We'll run through some initial enumeration.  
SMBMap Doesn't produce any results (at this point I'm beginning to think that my syntax is incorrect, but this has worked elsewhere).
```
smbmap -H $ip                                                                                                            130 ⨯ 1 ⚙
[+] IP: 10.10.10.40:445 Name: 10.10.10.40 
```
I 'touch' SMB real quick with SMBClient to list out the shares:
```
smbclient -L \\\\$ip -U 'anonymous'                                                                                            1 ⚙

I can connect to \Share, but it doesn't appear anything is there:
```
smbclient \\\\$ip\\Share -U 'anonymous'                                                                                        1 ⚙

I created a new file on my machine in the same directory entitled 'test.txt' and put some random text within. Navigated to Public\Documents and confirm that I have the ability to upload files here:
```
smb: \Public\Documents\> put test.txt
putting file test.txt as \Public\Documents\test.txt (0.1 kb/s) (average 0.1 kb/s)

Well - looks like this machine is vulnerable to Eternal Blue - which we should have already figured out from the machine name, right? ;)
