# Helpful Linux Commands
## Kali Maintenance
Check current Kali Linux Version (Compare with release history here: https://www.kali.org/releases/)
```bash
hostnamectl
```
Update core and applications (more frequently):
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove && sudo apt autoclean
```
Update distribution (less frequently):
```bash
sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
```
## Grep
[Reference](https://linuxize.com/post/grep-exclude/)
Search multiple files for specific keywords. Note that 'access-logs' here is the folder in the current directory I wanted to search through. `r=recursive`, `i=ignore case sensitivity`
```bash
grep -ir 'OS{' 'access-logs'
```

Exclude lines w/ certain strings. IN this example, exclude any line containing 'nologin' in the file /etc/passwd':
```bash
grep -wv nologin /etc/passwd
```
To display only the lines that do not match a search pattern, use the `-v` ( or `--invert-match`) option.
The `-w` option tells `grep` to return only those lines where the specified string is a whole word (enclosed by non-word characters).

## find
*Best Solution*
This is pulling files *and* directories *and* discarding any 'permission denieds'
```bash
find /* 2>/dev/null | grep "keyword"
```
>I've had better luck lately with:
```bash
find / -name impacket
```
>You can also specify folder like:
```bash
find /etc -name hosts
```

>/* searches the whole box for files with "keyword" (not only that, but also searches for the keyword inside of files that it can read)

```bash
find /* | grep "keyword" 
```
## Socat Bind Shell (LFI)
