## HTB - Very Easy

These machines are typically part of the 'Starting Point' paths and categorized as either 'Very Easy' or 'Easy'. Once you've completed them the first time through, it's pretty clear why they're labelled as such.

Still very good practice and I want to keep them here for reference. Especially when it comese to referencing things like the syntax for connecting to smb or telnet, which I often forget.
