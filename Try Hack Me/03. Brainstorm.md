You can find this room on [TryHackMe Here](https://tryhackme.com/room/brainstorm). This room is also covered in [The Cyber Mentor's Buffer OverFlows Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncBblM920jw) Youtube video.  
I went through the video in its entirety and took notes (of course), but I want to outline the steps I took to complete this THM room so that I also have them for reference later.

## Enumeration
We're asked to identify how many ports are open, so we run an nmap scan against the box. 
```
nmap -T4 --min-rate 2000 -p- $ip -Pn
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-01-27 13:32 MST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.249.91
Host is up (0.17s latency).
Not shown: 65532 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
9999/tcp open  abyss
```

I connected to 3389 via rdesktop and it does bring up my username, but we don't have a password to log in. I can confirm from here that the box is running Windows 7, though.

I connect to ftp anonymously, but when attempting 'dir' or 'ls' I receive the following error:
```
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||49326|)
```
To get around this, I connect using the -A (active) switch and all is well from there.
```
ftp $ip -A
Connected to 10.10.249.91.
220 Microsoft FTP Service

```

I download both files inside of this folder via 'get':
```
ftp> get chatserver.exe
local: chatserver.exe remote: chatserver.exe
200 EPRT command successful.

```
I attempted to launch the software via WINE and EDB-Debugger, but kept receiving permission denied errors. So we'll get these over to my test Windows VM and go from there.

I started up a python server on my linux machine in the same directory as where I'd saved the exe, and dll and downloaded these to my windows VM successfully.
```
python -m http.server 80  
```
Failed attempt - Will need to return later.
{: .warning }

In attempting to launch the application I'm met with lots of errors (despite having the .dll in the same location) and it appears that this may not work on Windows 10. Tried running in compatability mode, running as administrator, etc. and it just doesn't want to work.

It looks like I can't download a Win7 iso from the Windows Evaluation center, so maybe this exercise is a bust for now. I'm going to attempt to find a 32-bit Win7 ISO or perhaps there are other Buffer Overflow related machines on THM I can take advantage of to work through this one.
