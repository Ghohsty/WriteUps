## Try Hack Me Machines

[Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com) is a great resource for beginners. They offer many 'rooms' and challenges that you can utilize to focus on specific topics relating to ethical hacking as well as full environments ([like wreath](https://tryhackme.com/room/wreath)) to practice on.

I'll include a few write ups here that I think are pertinent to the OSCP for reference. **Check out my profile below!  **
